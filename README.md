## Overview

This project was completed as part of my internship at **Zscaler**, a leading cloud security company. The work primarily focused on frontend development and included the following key functionalities:

- Implementation of dynamic UI components
- CRUD operations
- Search and advanced filtering features
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Real-time form validation
- Data grid-level validations
- Unit testing and End-to-End (E2E) testing using **Playwright**

All development followed a structured CI/CD workflow:
- Code changes were committed via Pull Requests (PRs)
- PRs were reviewed and merged into the `6.3` (staging) branch
- After successful QA verification, changes were pushed to the production `6.2` branch

## Technologies Used

- **React** (Component-based frontend development)
- **Redux** (Global state management)
- **Playwright** (Automated E2E and unit testing)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **SCSS**
- **RESTful API Integration**
