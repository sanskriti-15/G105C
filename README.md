## Overview

This project was developed as part of my internship at **Zscaler**. It focuses on frontend development and includes:

* User Interface implementation
* CRUD operations
* Search functionality
* Drag-and-drop UI features
* Form validation
* Data grid validation
* Unit and E2E testing using Playwright

After development, all code changes were raised as Pull Requests (PRs), reviewed by peers, merged into the `6.3` branch, and finally tested by QA before being promoted to the production `6.2` branch.

## Confidentiality Notice

Due to **Zscaler's confidentiality agreement**, I am not permitted to include:

* Screenshots of the application
* Any part of the source code

This restriction is in place to protect proprietary information and internal tools.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my mentors and team at Zscaler for their support and guidance throughout the internship.
